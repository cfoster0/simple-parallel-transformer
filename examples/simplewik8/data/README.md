# Data source

The simplewik8 data is a very basic dataset meant to emulate Matt Mahoney's original enwik8 dataset. The original enwik8 consisted of the first 100MB of the English language Wikipedia dump from March 3, 2006. It is used in the Hutter prize for compression algorithms: http://prize.hutter1.net/

By contrast, simplewik8 pulls the first 100MB from the Simple English Wikipedia dump from May 1, 2023. As such, it contains information that is more recent than the original, yet simpler in vocabulary & grammar. The particular dump this new dataset pulls from is here (note that this link may expire in the future): https://dumps.wikimedia.org/simplewiki/20230501/simplewiki-20230501-pages-articles.xml.bz2
